This book from Steven Bartlet is one of excellent reads that covers important tips to Self and Professional life. I came across this very recently(its late than never)  on Audio Book, quite astonished by the content i also got the physical copy as reference for my ‘Hall of Fame’

This Book has been writtern in 4 Pillars - Self, Story,Philosphy and Team

Here are my interesting bits from this book

## Pillar 1 Self

### Fill your Buckets in the right order

- What you know(Knowledge)
- What you can do(your skills)
- Who you know(your network)
- What you have(your resources)
- Whatthe world thinks of you(your reputation)

### You should Teach it to master it

- If you want to maste rit, do it publically and do it consistently
- Being able to simplify an idea and successfully sharing to others is path to understanding it and proof you can do. One ways we mask our lack of understanding of any idea is by using more, bigger words

### Never Disagree

- if you want to keep someone’s brain lit up and receptive to your point of you is you must not start with your response with statement of disagreement
- ‘
- find some thing common in agreement and then share your view or your rebuttal

### You do not choose what you believe

→ Our beliefs are not constant and it will change

For some of our most important beliefs we have no evidence at all, except that people we love or we trust hold these beliefs’

→ To Change the belief of others, simply telling they are wrong wont work either. They need to experience first party experience from their senses(thats why seeing is  believing )

→ How to you change other beliefs

Our brain considers new evidfence alongside the current evidence it has stored, if it agrees it takes, if it rebutes then it ignores

So instead of Attacking old beliefs inspire new ones and highlight the incredible positive impact of this new evidence without disagree with their existing beliefs

- Detail Self-Review can reduce any belief
    
    e.g: 
    
    study conducted where graduates were asked rate their understanding of their toilet at home and once they rated they were asked for step by step explantion of how it works once they attempted to explain its internal workings they were asked to rate again. their belief in their understanding dropped significantly
    
- Growth happens when you start doing things you are not qualified to do

### **Cognitive dissonance is not arrogance- Lean into your bizzare behavior**

- Cognitive dissonance is tension you experience when your thoughts conflict with your behavior
- When you dont understand lean in more, when it challenges your intelligence lean in more, when it makes you feel stupid lean in more, Dont block people that you dont agree with, Dont run from ideas that makes you unconfortable.

### Ask, Dont tell -Question /Behavior Effect

- Question, unlike statements , elicit an active response, - they make people think
    
    e.g: Will you recycle? vs please recycle
    
- Use coginitive dissonance in your favour , once some one answer yes then its more likely to come true as behavior

### Never fight a bad habit

- Trigger → Routine → Reward  (understand this pattern)
    - What triggers the action ,that creates positive or negative habit because it has become a routine and then you get reward of that action.
    - Now for bad habit replace the resource(e.g: cigerrate to a choclate) when that routine is triggered which is less harm . your pattern maintains
- When you focus too much on stopping something,you rebound and do it more
- When you create a new habit, take care of yourself and get as much sleep as you can

> ‘Sleep, Lift, Move,Smile, Laugh, Listen, Read, Save, Hydrate,Fast,Build, Create - Your habits are your future’
> 

### Always Prioritise your Foundation

You have one body, take care of your health. Their is no greater form of gratitude than taking care of yourself

## Pillar 2 Story

### Useful absurdity will define you more

- A brands publicity defined more by its usefless absurdity than its useful practicalities.
    
    e.g : Assume you setup a 100 ft climbing wall in office ,  sort of traction that it generated
    

- Normality is ignored, as this get into standard pattern, Absurdity sells , think different

### Avoid Wallpaper at all costs

- Habituation is a phenomenon in which the brains adjusts the repeated stimuli, by ignoring or downgrading their significance . This coginitive phenomenon frees up the mental capacity that we need for other things. this is basics of survival
    - “e.g: subscribe to this you tube channel is usually ignored”

- Wallpaper is a overuse of popular terms, pharses and call for action the point that brain habituates to them and tunes them out

- Great marketing is uncomfortable, it springs a dormant brain into a neurological frenzy

### Shoot your psychological moonshots first

This is a great concept, best in this book

<aside>
💡 A Psychological moonshot is a relatively small investment that drastically improves the perception of something

</aside>

e.g: UBER is a pyschological moonshot , it addresses following customer needs at pyschological level

1. The PEAK and END RULE: The Two moments that matter most . Customers will judge their entire experience on just two moments - the best(or worst) part and the end
2. IDLENESS AVERSION - Our need for justifiable business - *people who are busy are happier than people who are idle , e.g: Uber  give u indication that driver is reaching to your destination while you wait for the car* 
3. OPERATIONAL TRANSPARENCY - Brands should be Glass boxes
    
    e.g: Uber gives clear details of bills, where the driver is etc to lower level . Usually people accept when they know whats happening
    
4. UNCERTAINITY ANXIETY - e:g Domino’s visibility of pizza, people dont want pizza delivered faster, but they want certainty
5. THE GOAL GRADIENT EFFECT - SPEEDING UP NEAR THE FINISH LINE - its been repeatedly proven that what motivates us most is how close we are to achieving a goal. we work faster the closer we are to success

> Its usually easy to change perception than the reality, Our truth is not what we see, Our truth is the story we choose to believe
> 

> Making things easier isnt necessarily the path to a psychological moonshot; sometimes you have to do the opposite, increase friction, wait times and inconvenience, to achieve the same increase in perceived value
> 

> Value does not exist. It’s a perception we reach with expectations we meet
> 

> Also Framing is important aspect, It isnt about lying and deception. It is about how you present your product or service through most factual and compelling lens
> 

### Use Goldilocks to your advantage

Goldilocks effect is a type of ‘anchoring’. Its sort of cognitive bias where individuals rely too heavily on seemingly irrelevant information (’the anchor’) when making decisions. In most scenarios true value is something nothing more than your opinion.

People are inclined to make value judgements based on context, so offering range of options including economy, standard and premium version of your product can tell the story and affect potential customers perception of your standard offering.

The Context creates the value.

### Let them try and they will Buy

Getting your product into customers had remains incredibly powerful tool for sales, marketing and brands

### Fight for first 5 seconds

No matter whats the medium, you must earn the right to attention you are seeking within first five seconds

Average human attention span is has dropped from 12s to 8s. ‘You have attention span of goldfish’ is becoming  irrelevant quote as even goldfish has attention span of 9 seconds

> ‘Attention might just be the most generous gift that anyone can give’
> 

## Pillar 3 Philosophy

### Small stuff and Small misses

> Good work is culmination of hundreds of tiny details, so Sweat on small stuff
> 

Small miss now creates a big miss latter

> Smallest seeds of Todays negligence will bloom into tomorrows biggest secrets
> 

### Dont be a ostritch

- Like a proverbial ostrich with its head buried in the sand , the avoidance ofen leads to even greater distress
- Accept uncomfortable truths as fast as possible
- Engaging in uncomfortable conversation early paves the way for resolution

> In Business, the person with fewest blind spots stands the greatest chance of victory
> 

### Your skill is worthless but your context is more valuable

- Our skills hold no intrensic value
- The value of any skill is determined the context of which its required
- The perception of skills rarity influences how much people value it
- People will access the worth of your skill based on how much value they believe it can generate for them

e.g: Joshua Bell Violinist street performance in Washington DC Substation vs performing in a prestigious concert hall

> “To be considered the best in your industry you dont need to be best at ONE THING , You need to be good at variety of complementary and rare skills that your industry values and competitor lacks’
> 

### Discipline equation - death, time and discipline

- Discipine is the ultimate secret to being successful in any ambition we have
    - humans struggle to comprehend infinity and also cannot comprehend time, it slowly creeps intangibly and invisbily
    - death reflection excercises report high life satisfaction, stronger desire to spend time wisely, pursue meaningful goals , increased kindness and generosity
    - Time Betting mental model - you have finite chips and every chip get spent every hour, then where u will spend
    - Discipline equation = Value of the Goal + Reward of the Pursuit - Cost of the Pursuit
    - 

> “Being Selective about how you spend your time and who you spend your time with is greatest sign of self-respect’
> 

## Pillar 4 - The Team

### Leverage the Power of Progress , Superpower of small wins

- `How to create prospective progress in teams - steps`
    - `Creating meaning`
    - `Setting Clear anf Actionable Goals`
    - `Providing Autonomy`
    - `Removing Friction`
    - `Broadcasting Progress (Celebrate)`
    
    > *“The most professionally rewarding feeling in the world is sense of Forward motion”*
    > 
    

### Ask Who NOT How - Delegate

> ‘Your Ego will insist you do ,Your Potential will insist you delegate
> 

### Raise the Bar

“Definition of the word ‘Company’ is just group of People’

### Learning never ends
