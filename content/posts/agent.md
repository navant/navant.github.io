## Interact with your Gmail with Agent GPT
25/8/2023
### Idea:

Sometimes we signup for too many news letters and information digests across different form and give our email. Idea is to create summary from newsletters i received based on day/author and create a summary email send to you

### How i POCed it

leverage Gmail API and Langchain agent 

[https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/gmail](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/gmail)

### Learning

- Getting gmail tkoen from credentials.json require some troubleshooting
- Summarise multiple emails usecase is not that straight forward
- You may try like read a particular email, create draft etc as interim usecases.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ You will hit the token limit for the above usecases of reading email and summarise when u execute the above steps for the usecase.

</aside>

### To be continued â€¦

### Troubleshooting

Getting the gmail access working is the hardest part. Credentials.json 

most of the time below step is failing

`from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import GmailToolkit`

`toolkit = GmailToolkit()`

troubleshooting steps

remember to generatae the web_app not a desktop app when generating O-Auth 2.0 chain

you should try importing token using [https://github.com/googleworkspace/python-samples/blob/main/gmail/quickstart/quickstart.py](https://github.com/googleworkspace/python-samples/blob/main/gmail/quickstart/quickstart.py) and then retry above method with active session

make sure your [localhost](http://localhost) port is configured currently in the redirect_uri ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63647151/gmail-api-keeps-changing-the-localhost-address-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63647151/gmail-api-keeps-changing-the-localhost-address-python))

Once above is good, then the entire flow of 

Create Gmail tool kit â†’ Initialise Agent with LLM â†’ Agent(Run) will work fine

Below are the gmail functions it has with langchain tools

- **GmailCreateDraft**
- **GmailSendMessage**
- **GmailSearch**
- **GmailGetMessage**
- **GmailGetThread**

### Classical error -

**InvalidRequestError**

: This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens, however you requested XX tokens (4018 in your prompt; 256 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.
